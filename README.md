Definitions:

New Moon (Dark Side of The Moon -Mulan)
    -when the Sun and Moon are aligned and the Sun and Earth are on opposite sides of the Moon

First Quarter Moon (half moon)
    -when the Moon has gone through the first quarter of it's orbit around Earth

Full Moon
    -when the Sun and Moon are aligned and are on opposite sides of the Earth

Third Quarter Moon (half moon)
    -occurs the momment the opposite side of the Moon is illuminated compared to the First Quarter

Blue Moon
    -Second full moon in a month
    
Supermoon (Full and New)
    -occurs when the Moon's orbit is it's closest to the Earth
    -not an official astronmical term and no official rules for how far or close the Moon must be to qualify 
    -our source (timeanddate.com) defines the closest oribit as: when the center of the Moon is less than 360,000 kilometers (223,694 miles) from the center of Earth.

Micromoon (Full and New)
    -occurs when the Moon's orbit is furthest from the Earth
    -not an official astronmical term and no official rules for how far or close the Moon must be to qualify
    -our source (timeanddate.com) defines the furthest orbit as: when the center of the Moon is farther than 405,000 kilometers (251,655 miles) from the center of Earth


Fun Fact
    -The term supermoon was first coined in 1979 by astrologer, Richard Nolle. He defined it as ‘a New or a Full Moon that occurs when the Moon is at or near (within 90% of) its closest approach to Earth in its orbit’. There has been no clear reason for why he chose %90.
    -The greatest difference between high and low tide is around Full Moon and New Moon. During these Moon phases, the gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun combine to pull the ocean’s water in the same direction.
